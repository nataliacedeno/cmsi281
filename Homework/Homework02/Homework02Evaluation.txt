Homework02 Evaluation
======================

Good work on this assignment!  I have a few suggestions/comments:

Your "queue.java" file had a compile error which flagged that the file name
was not "Queue.java" as you have named the class and the constructor.  THOSE
NAMES MUST MATCH to get it to compile from the command line.  Leads me to
believe you are using an IDE-type development environment and are NOT doing
a compilation from the command line before submitting your code.  This is a
MUST ~ please do so from now on.  I changed your file name and all is well.

You have duplicate code for your Link class, one in "Link.java" and one in
"CircularList.java".  When I try to compile everything at once in a command
window with "javac *.java" I get a compile error:

      Link.java:1: error: duplicate class: Link
      public class Link{
             ^
      1 error

Is there a reason you need two definitions for this class?  If not, why not
just use the external class?  Keeping that one will allow you to use it in
other programs later, improving your software success and lowering your time
of development in those cases.   Just sayin.....

Your testing coverage looks pretty good!  You can always do a little more,
but you seem to have covered everything nicely!  One example would be to try
to "pop()" something when you know the stack is empty, to make sure that you
get a message to that fact.

Nice work on Josephus!!

Everything works as advertised!  Good job on this assignment.


Evaluation follows.
