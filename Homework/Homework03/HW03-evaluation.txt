Homework03 Evaluation
======================
You MUST do problem 1, the "odd-even sort"

You MUST do EITHER problem 2, Huffman, OR problem 3, Simon.
Whichever one you choose is your option, but you must indicate
which one you choose.  If you want to do both of them, you will
be given extra credit for whatever points you get correct on
the second problem.  For example, if you choose to do Simon and
it is completely correct, and you do Huffman for extra credit
and get 5 out of 7 correct, you will get 136% for the assignment.
The extra points will be applied at the end of the semester to
improve your overall score for the course.

Assuming odd-even sort is correct, of course....

Nice work on this assignment!

Detailed comments:

Very nice work on this assignment!

Your sorter and your Simon work perfectly!  Most excellent and bodacious.

Huffman gets all the way through the encoding process so you have done great
work on that part.  However, I get a "NullPointerException" during decoding,
which comes from "decodeString()" at line 131.

I think the problem is that when you get to a leaf node you aren't checking
that you're at the "bottom" of that branch.  If you put in a check for that,
I think it'll work.  The "NullPointerException" is probably because there
isn't a child ~ those fields are set to null in a leaf node.

You still earn 1/2 credit on that part, and full credit for everything else
in this assignment, include the EC points!

Nice job ~ keep up the good work, you two ~ you're a great team!!
