Your code looks quite nice!

Consider spacing your code out vertically a little bit so that it is easier
for the reader to see groups and blocks.  For example:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class SayHello {

   public static void main (String[] args) {

      Scanner myInput = new Scanner( System.in );
      String inputName = myInput.nextLine();

      System.out.println("Hello, " + inputName + "!");
   }
}

One thing that is missing is prompting the user to enter a name or string of
some kind.  One basic idea of most programs is that they are designed to be
a user interface of some kind, so the more information you give to the user,
the better the user can use the program.

Nice job overall!
